Massive data strcture divided between five levels containing a different data structure each. 
The base of the structure is a graph that contains a binary tree on each node; binary trees contain a double list on each node; double lists contains a matrix on each node; then finally matrixes contain an array on each node.
Full structure is navigable and allows for the storage of lore information of lords of the rings franchise.
